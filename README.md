Repository for our COMP3004B project.


Currently, we don't have a team name, nor a project name.
More details to be decided later.


If you have a public PGP key for encryption and signing, you can place it under /public-keys/, with the filenames in the format:
`<firstname>-<lastname>.pub`
Never share your private key.
