Tasks:
	- Set up Android Studio project. (1 hour)
	- Wrote several tests to ensure proper configuration of Android Studio project. (1 hour)
	- Attempted to link C (native) code with Java code for Android Studio project. (3 hours)
		- This was successful; we can write our own native C/C++ code for the project.
	- Attempted to compile and use GMP (GNU Multiple Precision) with our project, for cryptography. (2 hours)
		- Failed, along with other libraries of similar complexity.
		- Ultimately resorted to using the arbitrary-precision arithmetic code in bc, the Linux-standard arbitrary-precision calculator.
	- Implemented RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Alderman) in C. (3 hours)
		- Has some test code to encrypt/decrypt a number.
		- Currently has no ability to convert text into a number.
		- Implementation works on x86-64, but has not been tested on ARM (ie. added to the Android Studio project, compiled, and tested on a simulator).

	Total time spent:

Next steps:
	- Come up with a formal plan for the design and back end of the application this coming week.
		- Although we understand the general idea of what must be done, we still need to actually write down the steps we will take.
		- This is so that we don't lose focus and so that we know the exact goals we need to meet.
	- Add a way to convert ASCII text into a number, so that we can encrypt an actual message with it.
		- In practice, it will be used to encrypt a symmetric key, which in turn is used to encrypt data. Unsure if ASCII-to-number conversion is strictly necessary.
		- This may be put off for later.
	- If there is time, for the sake of OpenPGP compliance, implement DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm).
		- This may be put off for later.
