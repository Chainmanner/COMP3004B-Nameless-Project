Monday February 17: 
  Modified my generateKeyPair function to save keys as a key store rather then a key holder: [2 Hours]
	It seems key holders require an upload to a central database
	Key pairs seem more convenient as they allow public and private keys to be conjoined well still retaining private key security
Tuesday February 18: 
  Modified encrypter and decrypter to work correctly with key pairs: [2 Hours]
	I needed to change the arguments for encrypt and decrypt
	I also needed to change the internal usage and representation of the user input arguments
