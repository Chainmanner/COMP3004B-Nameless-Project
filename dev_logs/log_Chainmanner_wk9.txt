Tasks:
	- Public key encryption and decryption has now been implemented. (2 hours)
		- Compatible with GnuPG.
	- Signing and verifying has been implemented. (1 hour)
		- RSA compatible with GnuPG.
		- DSA sign-only keys don't seem to be compatible.
	- Implemented the Private Folder feature. (5 hours)
		- Works exactly as expected so far. Don't think I'll need to come back to this.
	- Slight refactoring to decouple EncryptFilesFragment and DecryptVerifyFragment from the libraries being used. (1 hour)
		- KeyringFragment is still coupled.

Total time: 9 hours

Next Steps:
	- Finish up the other unimplemented features, listed below in no particular order. These NEED to be done before we hand in our final deliverable.
		- Decouple KeyringFragment from the cryptography libraries.
		- Inputting a picture straight from the camera
		- Inputting a video straight from the camera
		- Generating keypairs
		- Viewing more details about imported keys
			- This is, by common sense, supposed to be implemented. However, since we didn't explicitly promise it, this is a slighly lower priority.
	- Complete the last deliverable.
