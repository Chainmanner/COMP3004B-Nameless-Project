Tasks:
	- Public key encryption and decryption has now been implemented. (2 hours)
		- Compatible with GnuPG.
	- Signing and verifying has been implemented. (1 hour)
		- RSA compatible with GnuPG.
		- DSA sign-only keys don't seem to be compatible.
	- Worked on the Private Folder feature. (1 hour)
		- Not done yet, but I'll get it working before our oral exam on Friday, even if it (along with a few other features) is incomplete. Something's better than nothing.

Next Steps:
	- Implement the private folder.
	- Finish up the other unimplemented features:
		- Inputting a picture straight from the camera
		- Inputting a video straight from the camera
		- Generating keypairs
		- Viewing more details about imported keys
			- This is, by common sense, supposed to be implemented. However, since we didn't explicitly promise it, this is a slighly lower priority.
