Tasks:
	- Public key encryption and decryption has now been implemented. (2 hours)
		- Compatible with GnuPG.

Next Steps:
	- Implement signing and verification.
	- Implement the private folder.
	- Finish up the other unimplemented features:
		- Inputting a picture straight from the camera
		- Inputting a video straight from the camera
		- Generating keypairs
		- Viewing more details about imported keys
			- This is, by common sense, supposed to be implemented. However, since we didn't explicitly promise it, this is a slighly lower priority.
