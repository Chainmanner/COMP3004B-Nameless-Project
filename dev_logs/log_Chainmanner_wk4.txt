Edited Wednesday February 19, 2020 to indicate that I forgot to upload this. Sorry about that. Please don't dock too many marks for that, it happens sometimes.

Tasks:
	- Created the UI for Encrypt/Sign File under Encryption Tools. (4 hours)
		- It's interactive, too.
	- Met with the team to discuss the work to be done over Reading Week. (1 hour)

Next steps:
	- Finish the UI for the Encryption Tools over the reading week.
	- Add functionality to "encrypt or sign" files and save the output, minus the encryption/signing step itself due to the need to get a prototype out the door ASAP.
