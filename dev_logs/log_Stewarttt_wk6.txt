	Teem meeting:
		We discusses our prototype for our group presentation
		We discussed that we should all make UML component diagrams for our code for our presentation
		We discussed a few back-end things for me to implement
			Instead of key store files in the public key cryptography system:
				Use public/private key pairs which can be exported
			Add more algorithms and ciphers the user can choose from for the public key system
			Add a google drive back-end:
				upload files
				download files
				application backup system
