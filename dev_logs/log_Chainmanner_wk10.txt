Tasks:
	- Key generation now implemented in the Keyring of the Encryption Tools. (2 hours)
		- Had to make a few edits to PublicKey.generateKeyPair() to accomplish this.

Next Steps:
	- Complete the last deliverable's documentation.
	- Finish up the other unimplemented features, listed below in no particular order. These NEED to be done before we hand in our final deliverable.
		- Exporting and deleting keys
			- Forget what I said about viewing more details, we don't strictly need that at this time.
		- Inputting a picture or video straight from the camera.
