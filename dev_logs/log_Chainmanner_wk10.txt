Tasks:
	- Key generation now implemented in the Keyring of the Encryption Tools. (2 hours)
		- Had to make a few edits to PublicKey.generateKeyPair() to accomplish this.
	- Keys can now be exported and/or deleted from the Keyring. (1 hour)

Total time: 3 hours

Next Steps:
	- Complete the last deliverable's documentation.
	- Finish up the other unimplemented features, listed below in no particular order. These need to be done before we hand in our final deliverable.
		- Inputting a picture or video straight from the camera.
		- Backing up the Password Manager's DB, possibly also keys and other things, to Google Drive.
			- This is outside of my jurisdiction (Password Tools are Kavan's job), but if necessary, I can help with this.
			- We may or may not have enough time for this.
