Saturday January 26:
  Time:
	Researched verious types of symmetric key encription and how to implement AES inside an application [1 Hour]
	Researched weather to use c or java for AES encription tool (choose java) [1 Hour]
		First I wrote a failed prototype using C [2 Hour]
	wrote a java program which contains a collection of functions used to encrypt and decrypt various forms of data using the AES cypher [2 Hours]
		currently only supports encription and decryption of text files
		next photo files will be implemented
	Implemented all three AES keys (128, 192, 256 bit) [1 Hour]
	Tool is accsessable via a command line interface, and can read files [1 Hour]

	Total Time for day 8 hours.
  Notes:
	I spent a lot of time setting up things and doing research on how to actually implement AES encryption and decryption in code
	It turns out the task it not too trivial due to the oversaturation of encription and decryption packages out there
	I wrote a failed prototype using C, turns out its much harder to do this in C.
  Things to add:
	Next, im going to try and allow the application to encrypt/decrypt mp3 files and jpg/png files.
	Also, I going to add the ability to save the encripted/decrypted information into the file system
