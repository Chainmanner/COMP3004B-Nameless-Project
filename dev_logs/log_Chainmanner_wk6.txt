Tasks:
	- Finished the Encrypt/Sign UI. (1 hour)
	- Finished the Decrypt/Verify UI. (2 hours)
	- Merged all of our projects together. (5 hours)
		- Some things have been refactored/separated.
		- Conner, I had to modify some of your AES code so that we can directly encrypt/decrypt the data without writing to a file.
			Given the minimum SDK version as well, I had to also comment out some stuff you did. Hope you don't mind.
		- Otherwise, no new features added.

Next Steps:
	- At the time of writing, the project still isn't in a presentable state.
		- Will make the main menu, maybe clean up some stuff as well.
	- Need to do the component diagram for our report. I'll get on it as soon as I can.
