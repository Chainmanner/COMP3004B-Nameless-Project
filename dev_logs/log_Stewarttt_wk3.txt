Wednesday January 29: [1.5 Hours]
  Time: [1.5 Hours]
  	Team meeting [1.5 Hours]
		integrated password generator with Kavans user interface
	We decided the next thing I should do is work on AES encryption for all files.
	After this, it was also discussed I look into OpenPGP protocols.
Thursday January 30:
  Researched methods for encrypting files using AES: [30 minutes]
	I was looking to see if I should convert files to byte streams or text streams
	Settled on byte streams
Friday January 31:
  Looked into how to convert passwords to hashes: [15 minutes]
	Settled on using PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) key derivation function
Saturday February 1: [4 Hours]
  Implemented PBKDF2 password hasher and removed old password hasher
Sunday February 2: [4.25 Hours]
  Implemented encrypt and decrypt functions capable of reading and writing non text files: [3 Hours]
	Accomplished by reading and writing all files as byte streams rather then text streams like before
	Required reworking all read and write functions
  Implemented a feature to allow data to be returned either as a saved file or as a byte stream returned to the caller [1 Hour]
  Compiled my notes and completed my dev log for the week [15 minutes]
Notes:
  It may take some work to integrate this with the UI being created by the others. I plan on doing this next group meeting.
  Some code may need slight modifications, but overall I think this code should allow for all files to be encrypted or decrypted
  This application won't work directly with a database, meaning I will also need to make some code later to integrate the database (which is not made yet) with the encryption tool
	However, the code created this week is enough to do simple encryption and decryption within a file system environment
	Once the database is made by the other group members, I will work on the integration code
  Until then, I will look into OpenPGP protocols.
Total Time This Week:
  [10.5 Hours]
