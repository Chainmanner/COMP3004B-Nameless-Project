Tasks:
	- Created a menu for the Encryption Tools. (2 hours)
		- Non-functional.
		- I was hoping to get the whole front end done, but due to unfamiliarity with Android studio, technical problems, and other schoolwork to be done, I was unable to do more than just the main menu at the time of writing.
		- Will continue on this tonight and before the next meeting.
	- Attempted to make navigation between menus, instead of spawning a new Activity for each menu. (2 hours)
		- Failed. Will look for examples, maybe they can help.
	- Researched how to add navigation between screens. (1 hour)

Next steps:
	- Keep working on the front end for the Encryption Tools.
	- Make it possible to navigate between menus, instead of spawning a new Activity for each menu.
		- Will look for examples on this.
	- Once the front end is done, actually implement the encryption/decryption functionality.
