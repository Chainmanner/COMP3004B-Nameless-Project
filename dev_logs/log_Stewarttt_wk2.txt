  Discussion for integrating password generator with UI [30 minutes]
Tuesday January 28: [30 minutes]
  Researching ASCII/UTF stuff [30 minutes]
Wednesday January 29: [1.5 Hours]
  Time: [1.5 Hours]
  	Team meeting [1.5 Hours]
		We discussed ways to integrate out various pieces of code
    We decided I would do a lot of the back end Java stuff
  Notes:
  	I'm going to need to create the password generator back-end

Saturday February 1: [4 Hours]
  Created the first two functions for my password generator
  The two functions work with ASCII encoding
  the first method creates a password using alphabetical characters with the option for capitals
  The second uses alphanumerical characters with symbols
Sunday February 2: [4 Hours]
  Created the final two functions for the password generator
  The two functions work with utf-8 encoding
  The first method generates alphanumerical passwords with symbols using characters from a veriety of common languages
  The second method creates any valid utf-8 string with any character (except the null character), including characters that are not normally used as keyboard input
  Added documentation
  Added a JSON file to automatically launch the file with the correct parameters from Microsoft visual studio
Modified program interface:
  Program can now output to either the terminal/file or output a string into another program
    This means the program can now effectively be called from inside another program
  Added encapsulation along with getter and setter methods for important data, making it harder for a hacker to read the password as its being created
  Added JSON support for utf-8 code
  Added more documentation to the code I produced
  Finished Weekly log for uploading
Notes:
  Still have not added changes to AES program to encrypt alternative file formats (meaning music/video/photo files)
    Need to research how this is done
Total Time This Week:
	[10.5 Hours]
